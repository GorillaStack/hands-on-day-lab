# hands on day 3 - lab 4

Here is some awesome content for the people coming along to the AWS Hands on Day 3.

Check out the 3 CloudFormation templates under the `cf/` directory

1. `vpc.yml` - for a vpc stack with 3 public and 3 private subnets, NAT Gateway, Internet Gateway and all routing.
1. `sandbox.yml` - for a sandbox enviornment, some Autoscaling groups, some standalone ec2 instances, RDS instances and a dynamoDB Table
1. `batch.yml` - let's create an awesome AWS Batch environment.  Two queues and two compute environments.  This is a great starting point with AWS Batch.
